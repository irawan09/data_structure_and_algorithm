# Data Structure and  Algorithm

A data structure is a method of storing or representing data in a computer so that it may be used effectively. Computing time is highly influenced by the data structures chosen and the algorithms prepared. The more efficiently algorithms are prepared, paired with the appropriate data structure, the faster computation time and less memory consumption on the device will be. The kotlin programming language is used throughout this repository. What's the deal with Kotlin? JetBrains created Kotlin, a modern multi-paradigm programming language. It originally surfaced in 2011 and has since evolved into one of the most interesting languages currently available. One of the reasons Kotlin is so popular among developers is that it makes app creation easier by providing a large number of pre-built classes and functions. The Kotlin Standard Library, which comprises the Kotlin language's fundamental components, wraps Kotlin's classes and utilities. You'll discover a number of tools and data kinds to aid in the development of your apps in this library.
